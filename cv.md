## About Me

I am 18 years old. I am learning computer science at the univercity.I am very new at this. Considering that this field is very broad, I think that the university is not enough. I try to take extra courses. That's why I decided to take this course on a friend's advice.

### My Strenghts:
 - Hard work
 - Self-preservation
 - Quick learner

##Skills:
 - JavaScript (very basics)
 - C++(basics)

Code examples:

`int main() 
{
	std::vector<int> v = {10, 12, 3, 4, 15 };
	for (auto  m : v) 
		std::cout << m << ' ';
	std::cout << '\n';
	for (auto  n : {-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}) 
		std::cout << n << ' ';
	std::cout << '\n';
}
